# Accessible Carousel
Build a carousel that's more accessible

## Objective
Create a carousel that is more accessibility friendly and uses aria controls.

### Why
Based on my research (hours of Googling), carousels are generally considered bad for accessibility.

Also, apparently only about 1% of users actually interact with carousels on a website, but websites still use them and users with disabilities still come across them... So, I felt it was still worth it to explore.

### Goal
My goal is to build a carousel that is more accessibility friendly

## Note
I'll update this over time as I learn more about accessibility and best practices (I'm still a beginner). If you would like to give me pointers, please don't hesitate! (:
