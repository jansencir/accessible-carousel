# Accessible Carousel
Build a carousel that's more accessible

## Objective
Create a carousel that is more accessibility friendly and uses aria controls.

### Why
Based on my research (hours of Googling), carousels are generally considered bad for accessibility.

Also, apparently only about 1% of users actually interact with carousels on a website, but websites still use them and users with disabilities still come across them. So, I felt it was still worth it to explore.

### Goal
My goal is to build a carousel that is more accessibility friendly

## Problems

## Design Details

- A

Carousel uses `aria-hidden` instead of `z-index`
